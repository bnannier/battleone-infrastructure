Hi there!

We received a password reset request for your BattleOne account, but the request appears to be invalid or has expired.

This could happen for several reasons:
- The reset link has expired (links are valid for 1 hour)
- The link has already been used
- There was an error in the request

If you still need to reset your password, please visit our login page and click "Forgot Password" to start a new password reset process.

If you didn't request a password reset, you can safely ignore this email. Your account remains secure.

Best regards,
The BattleOne Team
