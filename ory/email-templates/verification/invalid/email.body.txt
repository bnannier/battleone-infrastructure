Hi there!

We received an email verification request for your BattleOne account, but the request appears to be invalid or has expired.

This could happen for several reasons:
- The verification link has expired (links are valid for 1 hour)
- The link has already been used and your email is already verified
- There was an error in the request

If your email is not yet verified and you need a new verification link, please log into your BattleOne account and request a new verification email from your account settings.

If you didn't request email verification, you can safely ignore this email.

Best regards,
The BattleOne Team
